BEGIN_TEXT
In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon.  One is a $s1, and the other is a $s2.  Each shape is drawn in a single color.  Suppose you believe me when I tell you that, 
$BCENTER
if the $s1 is $c1, then the $s2 is $c2.
$ECENTER
$BR
  What do you therefore know about the truth value of the following statements?
$BR
\{ $tf -> print_q \}

END_TEXT

ANS(str_cmp( $tf->ra_correct_ans )   ) ;

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The main thing to realize is that we do not know the colors of these two shapes, but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could have a $c1 $s1 and $c2 $s2.  We could have a $s1 that was not $c1 but a $c2 $s2.  Or we could have a $s1 that was not $c1 and a $s2 that was not $c2.  The case in which the $s1 is $c1 but the $s2 is not $c2 cannot occur, as that would make the statement false.
