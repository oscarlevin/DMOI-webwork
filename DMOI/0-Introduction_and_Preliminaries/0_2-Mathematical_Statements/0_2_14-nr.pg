BEGIN_PGML
For a given predicate [`P(x)\text{,}`] you might believe that the statements [`\forall x P(x)`] or [`\exists x P(x)`] are either true or false.  How would you decide if you were correct in each case?

a.  To prove [`\exists x P(x)`] is true:

    [_____]{$existstrue}


a.  To prove [`\exists x P(x)`] is false:

    [_____]{$existsfalse}   


a.  To prove [`\forall x P(x)`] is true:

    [_____]{$foralltrue}


a.  To prove [`\forall x P(x)`] is false:

    [_____]{$forallfalse}

# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a.  We are simply claiming that there is some element [`n`] in the domain of discourse for which [`P(n)`] is true.  If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim.


a.  Here we are claiming that no element we find will make [`P(n)`] true.  The only way to be sure of this is to verify that _every_ element of the domain makes [`P(n)`] false.  Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that [`\forall x P(x)`] is true.   


a.  The claim that [`\forall x P(x)`] means that [`P(n)`] is true no matter what [`n`] you consider in the domain of discourse.  Thus the only way to prove that [`\forall x P(x)`] is true is to check or otherwise argue that [`P(n)`] is true for all [`n`] in the domain.


a.  To prove [`\forall x P(x)`] is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which [`P(n)`] is false.  This is often called a counterexample.
