BEGIN_PGML

Consider the expression [$expression].


[@  $mc  ->  print_q()  @]*
[@  $mc  ->  print_a()  @]*

 Without computing the numerical value of the expression above, find a number [`n`] such that the experession is equal to [`2^n`]. 
(You might want to replace [$n] with smaller numbers and look for a pattern.)

[`n`] = [_______]
